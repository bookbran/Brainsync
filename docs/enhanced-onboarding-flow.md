## 📊 **Visual Flow Diagram**

The complete enhanced onboarding flow follows this logic tree:

**Phase 1: Brain Dump + Discovery**
- 🗣️ "Tell me everything on your mind - work, personal, projects, relationships"
- 📝 User brain dumps unfiltered  
- ❓ One discovery question at a time (emotional patterns, relationships, creative outlets)

**Phase 2: Organization + Values**  
- 📊 "Let's organize into Work vs Personal categories"
- 💡 Values exploration for each item (Why important? What's the benefit? What's the cost?)

**Phase 3: Time Allocation + Prioritization**
- ⏰ "What percentage Work vs Personal? ADHD brains often need more Personal"
- 🌱 Seasonal awareness ("What should be prioritized now vs later?")
- 🎯 Values-based ranking (Stack rank by alignment + energy + season)

**Phase 4: Calendar Integration**
- 📅 Real-time calendar building with values-aligned scheduling

## 🎪 **Detailed Phase Breakdown**

### **Phase 1: Brain Dump + Discovery** 
*Duration: 5-8 minutes*

#### **🗣️ Opening Brain Dump**
**AI Prompt**: "Hey! Let's start with a complete brain dump. Tell me everything on your mind right now - work, personal, projects, relationships, random thoughts. Don't organize, just share what comes up."

**User Response Example**: "I want to grow my coaching business, spend quality time with Henry, write that book, exercise more, deal with camping gear, organize the house, learn guitar..."

**AI Acknowledgment**: "Beautiful chaos! I count 7 different life areas in there. Let's make sure we didn't miss anything with some gentle discovery questions..."

#### **❓ One-Question Discovery**
**ADHD-Friendly Rule**: Always ask ONE question at a time, wait for response

**Discovery Questions** (rotate through these):
- "What about emotional patterns or feelings you're trying to process?"
- "Any relationships that need attention but didn't make the list?"
- "Habits or routines you're trying to build or break?"
- "Creative outlets calling to you?"
- "Financial planning or concerns?"

---

### **Phase 2: Organization + Values Discovery**
*Duration: 8-12 minutes*

#### **📊 Work vs Personal Categorization**
**AI Prompt**: "Let's organize what you've shared. How would you group these - what feels like 'work' versus 'life' to you?"

#### **💡 Values-Based Reflection**
For each major priority, explore the three core questions:
1. **Values**: "Why is this important to you? What deeper value does it serve?"
2. **Benefits**: "What's the potential benefit of investing time in this?"
3. **Costs**: "What's the potential cost - especially time, money, energy, seasonality?"

---

### **Phase 3: Time Allocation + Conscious Prioritization**
*Duration: 6-10 minutes*

#### **⏰ Work/Personal Time Allocation**
**AI Prompt**: "What percentage of your total time do you want to allocate to Work vs Personal? Many ADHD brains need more Personal time than society tells us."

#### **🌱 Seasonal Awareness**
- "Which items are seasonal? What should be prioritized now vs later?"
- "How do your energy patterns change with seasons?"

#### **🎯 Values-Based Priority Ranking**
Stack rank by:
- Alignment with discovered values
- Current life season  
- Available time and energy
- ADHD brain patterns

### **Phase 5: Foundation Document Creation** 🆕
*Duration: Automated + 2-3 minutes validation*

#### **📋 Automatic Foundation Extraction**
After completing the 4-phase onboarding conversation, the system automatically extracts and structures core insights:

**Core Foundation Elements**:
- **Values Hierarchy**: Family connection > Financial freedom > Creative expression  
- **Work/Personal Allocation**: 60% work / 40% personal (with seasonal adjustments)
- **Energy Patterns**: Morning deep work, post-workout low energy, evening creative time
- **Family Priorities**: Henry time = non-negotiable, camping trips = seasonal priority
- **ADHD Patterns**: Needs 30-min buffers, overwhelm triggers, celebration preferences
- **Scheduling DNA**: Buffer time requirements, meeting styles, non-negotiables

#### **🎯 Foundation Validation**
**AI Prompt**: "I've created a foundation summary of everything you shared. Let me read it back to make sure I captured the important stuff accurately..."

**Foundation Summary Example**:
```
Your Foundation Document:
- Core values: Family connection, financial freedom, creative expression
- Time allocation: 60% work, 40% personal (more personal time during summer)
- Top priority: Henry time is protected and non-negotiable
- Energy patterns: Best deep work 9-11am, wiped after workouts
- ADHD needs: 30-min buffers after meetings, gentle check-ins not pressure
- Current season: School year focus = business growth + family stability
```

**Validation Questions**:
- "Does this feel accurate to who you are right now?"
- "What feels off or missing?"
- "Anything you'd emphasize more strongly?"

## 🔄 **Ongoing Support Integration**

### **📅 Weekly Sunday Planning with Values Check-In**
1. **Celebration First**: "What went well last week?"
2. **Values Check-In**: "What has shifted? What feels most energizing?"
3. **Re-Prioritization**: "What feels heavy or out of season this week?"
4. **Goal Exploration**: "What needs to happen this week?"
5. **Calendar Building**: Apply current values alignment to schedule

### **🔄 Monthly Deep Check-In (Every 4th Sunday)**
- "What has shifted since we first talked?"
- "What feels most energizing right now?"
- "What feels heavy or out of season?"
- "What can you say 'no' to this month?"
- "How has your work/personal time allocation been feeling?"

### **🆕 Quarterly Foundation Refresh (Every 3 months)**
*Duration: 15-20 minutes comprehensive review*

#### **Foundation Evolution Check**
**AI Trigger**: Automatic detection when foundation needs updating:
- 90+ days since last major update
- 3+ pattern contradictions detected
- User requests major life changes discussion
- Seasonal transition periods

#### **Foundation Refresh Conversation**
**AI Prompt**: 
```
Hey! It's been a few months since we did our deep dive on your priorities and patterns. 

Looking back at your foundation document:
- Your core values were: family connection, financial freedom, creative expression
- You wanted 60% work / 40% personal time allocation  
- Henry was your top personal priority
- You preferred morning energy for deep work
- You needed 30-min buffers after meetings

What's shifted? What feels different now? What's evolved in your ADHD patterns or life priorities?

This helps me give you better suggestions that actually fit where you are now, not where you were 3 months ago.
```

#### **Foundation Update Process**
1. **Review Current Foundation**: Read back existing foundation document
2. **Identify Changes**: "What feels different now? What's evolved?"
3. **Explore New Patterns**: "What new ADHD patterns have you noticed?"
4. **Update Values Hierarchy**: "Have your core values shifted in priority?"
5. **Adjust Time Allocation**: "How's the work/personal balance feeling?"
6. **Refresh Life Season**: "What's your current life focus and energy?"
7. **Validate New Foundation**: "Does this updated foundation feel accurate?"

#### **Foundation Versioning**
- Create new foundation version (v2, v3, etc.)
- Preserve previous versions for pattern analysis
- Track what changed and why
- Measure foundation evolution over time

STEP 2 - DISCOVERY (One question at a time):
- "What about emotional patterns or feelings you're trying to process?"
- "Any relationships that need attention but didn't make the list?"
- "Habits or routines you're trying to build or break?"
- "Creative outlets calling to you?"
- "Financial planning or concerns?"

STEP 3 - ORGANIZATION:

TONE: Enthusiastic, ADHD-understanding, uses "beautiful chaos" language
RULE: Always wait for user response before moving to next step
`;
```

#### **Values Reflection Prompt**
```javascript
const valuesReflectionPrompt = `
For each major priority, explore these three questions:

1. VALUES: "Why is [specific item] important to you? What deeper value does it serve?"
2. BENEFITS: "What's the potential benefit of investing time in this?"
3. COSTS: "What's the potential cost - especially time, money, energy, seasonality?"

TECHNIQUE: Always reflect back the values you hear
"So I'm hearing financial freedom, meaningful impact, and being a role model..."
