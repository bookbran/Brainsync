- "Celebrating your active choices, even the 'unproductive' ones"
- "Permission to be human: Choose what works for YOUR brain today"
- "The first AI that asks 'What do you want to choose?' instead of 'What should you do?'"
- "Your scattered brain deserves gentle guidance, not guilt trips"

### 🆕 **Authentic ADHD Brand Voice Examples** (From Research)

- "Mental Health Gaps" (not "empty time" or "wasted space")
- "Conscious choice" (not "compliance" or "following the plan")

**Choice Prompt Examples:**
*Yo! 7 meetings back-to-back Thursday? Bold choice! 🫠 Options:*

- 💀 *Embrace madness + Friday recovery*
