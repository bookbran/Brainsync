# 📋 goodberry - Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## The Calendar Revolution for ADHD Brains

## 🌟 **User Experience Vision** (From Landing Page)

### **Core Vision**: "What If Your Calendar Actually Understood ADHD?"

**The Emotional Journey We're Building**:
goodberry transforms the Sunday planning experience from overwhelming anxiety ("Sunday Scaries") into energizing self-discovery ("Sunday Celebration"). Our AI celebrates what you've accomplished, learns from how you actually work, and plans with flexibility built in.

**The Partnership Reality**:
Most ADHD people either avoid Sunday planning entirely (because it feels overwhelming) or attempt it and feel like failures when rigid plans don't work with chaotic, beautiful brains. We're building something different: **ADHD partnership** with an AI that reflects the best of human wisdom and compassion, helping you gain control and realize your goals through partnership, not pressure.

This isn't calendar software - it's **ADHD partnership**. An AI that celebrates your hyperfocus victories, gently intervenes during brain traps, remembers your patterns better than you do, and builds deeper understanding over time through **persistent foundation intelligence**. The system creates a comprehensive foundation document from your initial conversation, tracks your wins and breakthroughs over time, and can reflect your own success story back to you when you need that gentle reminder of how far you've come. Conversations 2+ months later don't just feel personal - they feel like talking to someone who's been rooting for you all along. Openly AI, but with such great humor and ADHD understanding that you genuinely want to engage with it.

### **Key User Experience Principles**:

#### **ADHD Personality & Humor**
- **Tone Goal**: Genuinely funny, quirky ADHD brain you WANT to talk to - not fake friendly AI
- **Humor Style**: ADHD-specific humor that understands the chaos and makes you smile
- **Example**: "Yo! 7 meetings back-to-back Thursday? Bold choice! 🫠 Options: 🧘 Add breathing room / 🤖 Chaos train with snack reminders / 💀 Embrace madness + Friday recovery"
- **Authenticity Rule**: Openly AI but so understanding/funny that engagement feels natural
- **Success Criteria**: Users genuinely look forward to texts, not just tolerate them

#### **Celebration-First Approach**
- "Let's celebrate what happened last week! I see you had that big client presentation Thursday. How did it go?"
- "That's brilliant! 🎉 Post-workout + buffer time = presentation magic. Let's use that pattern for next week..."
- Every choice celebrated: "Your 'quick email check' became 2 hours of inbox mastery. You followed your hyperfocus!"

#### **ADHD-Friendly Language Patterns**
- "Your beautiful, chaotic brain" (not "disorder" or "problem")
- "Creative interpretations" (not "mistakes")
- "Brain trap" (not "bad behavior")
- "Mental Health Gaps" (not "empty time")
- "Conscious choice" (not "compliance" or "discipline")

#### **🚫 INCLUSIVE LANGUAGE GUIDELINES - ANTI-STIGMA POLICY**

**NEVER use language that separates people from their neurodivergence or makes it the defining characteristic:**

**❌ STIGMATIZING LANGUAGE (DON'T USE):**
- "your ADHD brain"
- "ADHD brains need..."
- "your neurodivergent brain"
- "people with ADHD are..."
- "ADHD makes you..."
- "because of your ADHD..."

**✅ INCLUSIVE LANGUAGE (USE INSTEAD):**
- "you" or "your brain"
- "you might find helpful..."
- "many people find..."
- "you deserve strategies that work for you"
- "let's find what works for you"
- "you experience..."

**CORE PRINCIPLE:** Speak to the whole person with understanding and respect. Never "other" someone or make their neurodivergence the primary lens through which they're addressed.

**APPROVED PHRASES:**
- "beautiful chaos" (sparingly, when natural)
- "brain trap" (for late-night spirals, procrastination loops)
- "mental health gaps" (for protected unscheduled time)
- "you deserve..." (empowering, person-first)
- "what works for you" (individualized, respectful)

#### **Three-Option Choice Framework Examples**
*Late Night + Early Important Event*:
```
"Hey! I notice you have that big client presentation at 9am tomorrow. 
Your beautiful, chaotic brain has 3 choices right now:

😴 Honor tomorrow (Get sleep to crush that presentation)
📱 15 more minutes (With a gentle timer so you don't spiral)  
📖 Something gentler (Journal, soft music, or gentle movement)

Whatever you choose, I celebrate it. No judgment here! 💙"
```

*Calendar Overwhelm Detection*:
```
"I'm looking at Thursday and wow - 7 meetings back-to-back? 
That feels like a lot even for a superhuman brain. 

Three gentle options:
🌱 Add a Mental Health Gap (15-30 min buffer between intense meetings)
🔄 Reschedule one non-urgent meeting (Which one feels most flexible?)
🎯 Keep as-is but prep support (What would help you thrive in this schedule?)

What feels most supportive for your beautiful brain?"
```

*Success-Based Confidence Building*:
```
"I have this huge presentation tomorrow and I'm totally freaking out about it."

"Hey, I want to remind you of something powerful. Remember that client presentation you had 3 months ago? You told me you were nervous then too, but you prepared by doing your morning workout first, then used your post-workout focus window for final prep.

You ended up saying 'I totally crushed it and the client signed!' 

What made that work so well was your energy strategy - you honored your ADHD brain instead of fighting it. You've got that same strength available tomorrow. Want to use that proven approach again? 💙"
```

#### **Sunday Planning Transformation**
**Before (Sunday Scaries)**:
- "Overwhelmed by all the competing priorities and draining people to deal with" 😵‍💫
- "Already feeling behind before the week even starts" 😰
- "Anxious about energy depletion from having to 'perform' all week" 😞

**After (goodberry Sunday Flow)**:
- "Celebrate last week's wins (planned AND unplanned!)" 🎉
- "Discover patterns: How did things actually get done?" 🤔
- "Use that wisdom to plan next week smarter" 💡
- "Build in flexibility and self-compassion" 💚

#### **Flexible Buffer Time Philosophy**
- **Definition**: User-configurable unscheduled time preserved for breathing room (~20% default)
- **Purpose**: Catching up, unexpected needs, or spontaneous activities - user's choice
- **Protection**: Never auto-schedule over designated buffer time, but user can choose to use it
- **Visual**: Clearly marked with gentle language, marked as "tentative" in calendar
- **Messaging**: "You have buffer time Thursday - want to schedule something or keep it open for whatever comes up?"
- **User Control**: Adjustable percentage based on individual ADHD patterns and preferences

#### **Conscious Choice Celebration**
Every calendar decision is celebrated as conscious choice-making:
- ✨ **Follow the Plan**: "Honor your future self's intentions"
- 🌊 **Adapt the Plan**: "Respond to what's actually happening"  
- 💡 **Follow Your Flow**: "Honor your hyperfocus and energy"
- 🎭 **Pivot Completely**: "Choose what you actually need"

### **The User Journey Promise**

#### **Enhanced 7-Phase Onboarding Conversation + Foundation Document Creation**
Natural dialogue integrating structured prioritization: goal exploration → brain dump & discovery → ADHD challenges → energy patterns → work/personal balance & time allocation → values-based prioritization → calendar integration → **foundation document creation**. No forms, just deep understanding through conversation that creates a permanent foundation for future interactions.

**📋 Full Implementation Details**: See `docs/enhanced-onboarding-flow.md` for complete conversation frameworks, AI prompt templates, and technical implementation guide.

**🆕 Enhanced Phase Details:**

##### **Phase 1: Opening Conversation + Structured Brain Dump**
- **Current Goal Exploration**: "Tell me about what you want to accomplish in your life right now"  
- **🆕 Structured Brain Dump**: "Let's start with a complete brain dump. Tell me everything on your mind right now - personal, work, projects, relationships, habits. Don't filter, just fast listing. We'll organize it together."
- **🆕 Example Flow**: "I want to grow my coaching business, spend quality time with Henry, write that book, exercise more, deal with camping gear, organize the house, learn guitar..."
- **🆕 AI Response**: "Beautiful chaos! I count 7 different life areas in there. Let's make sure we didn't miss anything with some gentle discovery questions..."

##### **Phase 2: New Items Discovery + Goal Architecture** 
- **🆕 One Question at a Time Discovery**: Following the brain dump, ask targeted questions to surface missing items:
  - "What about emotional patterns or feelings you're trying to process?"
  - "Any relationships that need attention but didn't make the list?"
  - "Habits or routines you're trying to build or break?"
  - "Creative outlets calling to you?"
  - "Financial planning or concerns?"
- **Enhanced Goal Architecture**: Break down discovered items yearly → monthly → weekly
- **🆕 ADHD-Friendly Pacing**: Always one question at a time, wait for response before moving on

##### **Phase 3: ADHD Challenges + Life Category Organization**
- **Current ADHD Challenge Exploration**: Understanding specific struggles
- **🆕 Work vs Personal Organization**: "Let's organize everything we've discovered into Work and Personal categories. What feels like 'work' vs 'life' to you?"
- **🆕 Example Organization**: 
  - **Work**: Coaching business growth, book writing, ADHD app development
  - **Personal**: Henry time, outdoor activities, health/exercise, home organization

##### **Phase 4: Energy Patterns + Deeper Values Reflection**
- **Current Energy Pattern Discovery**: When you're at your best/worst
- **🆕 Values-Based Reflection**: For each major item, explore:
  - "Why is growing your coaching business important to you? What deeper value does it serve?"
  - "What's the potential benefit of investing time in this?"
  - "What's the potential cost - especially time, money, energy, seasonality?"
- **🆕 Example Values Discovery**: "Coaching business = financial freedom + meaningful impact + modeling success for Henry"

##### **Phase 5: Joy & Balance + Time Allocation Strategy**
- **Current Joy/Drain Exploration**: What energizes vs. drains you
- **🆕 Work/Personal Time Allocation**: "What percentage of your total time do you want to allocate to Work vs Personal? Many ADHD brains need more Personal time than society tells us."
- **🆕 Seasonal Considerations**: "Which items are seasonal? What should be prioritized now vs later?"
- **🆕 Example Discussion**: "You mentioned 60% work, 40% personal. Let's talk about Henry time being seasonal - school year vs summer..."

##### **Phase 6: Resources & Constraints + Values-Based Prioritization**
- **Current Resource/Constraint Assessment**: Real-world situation
- **🆕 Conscious Prioritization**: Help stack rank based on:
  - Alignment with discovered values ("Henry-first" principle)
  - Current life season (school year priorities vs summer flexibility)
  - Available time and energy (post-workout focus windows)
  - ADHD brain patterns (hyperfocus opportunities vs energy drains)

##### **Phase 7: Calendar Integration + Final Structured Output**
- **Enhanced Calendar Integration**: Current calendar patterns + new prioritized structure
- **🆕 Clean Categorized Output**: Deliver organized list with each priority including:
  - **Deeper Value**: Why it matters (family connection, financial freedom)
  - **Benefit**: What success looks like (20 clients, sustainable boundaries)
  - **Cost**: Time/energy investment (3 hours/week coaching, mental energy for sales)
  - **Seasonal Note**: When to prioritize (Henry time intensifies during school breaks)
- **🆕 Monthly Check-in Framework**: Built-in structure for revisiting and re-prioritizing

**🆕 Sample Enhanced Conversation Flow:**
```
AI: "Let's start with a complete brain dump - tell me everything on your mind right now. Work, personal, relationships, random thoughts - don't organize, just share what comes up."

User: "I want to grow my coaching business, spend more quality time with Henry, finish writing that ADHD book, get back to exercising, deal with all that camping gear, organize the house, maybe learn guitar, handle the finances better..."

AI: "I love the variety! I'm hearing business growth, family connection, creative projects, health, organization, and personal enrichment. Let me ask one gentle question to see what we might be missing: What about emotional patterns or feelings you're trying to process?"

User: "Oh yeah, definitely the Sunday anxiety thing. And I've been putting off some difficult conversations..."

AI: "Thank you for sharing that. OK, let's organize what you've shared into Work and Personal categories. How would you group these - what feels like 'work' versus 'life' to you?"

[Later in conversation...]

AI: "Let's go deeper on the coaching business. Why is growing this important to you - what value does it serve?"

User: "Financial freedom, but also I love helping people. And I want to model success for Henry..."

AI: "Beautiful - so financial security, meaningful impact, and being a role model. What would be the cost of really investing in this growth?"

User: "Time, definitely. Maybe 10-15 hours a week for marketing and client work. Mental energy for putting myself out there..."

Your beautiful, chaotic brain has 3 choices right now:

😴 Honor tomorrow (Get sleep to crush that presentation)
📱 15 more minutes (With a gentle timer so you don't spiral)  
📖 Something gentler (Journal, soft music, or gentle movement)

Whatever you choose, I celebrate it. No judgment here! 💙"
```

*📅 Calendar Overwhelm Detection*:
```
"I'm looking at Thursday and wow - 7 meetings back-to-back? 
That feels like a lot even for a superhuman brain. 

Three gentle options:
🌱 Add a Mental Health Gap (15-30 min buffer between intense meetings)
🔄 Reschedule one non-urgent meeting (Which one feels most flexible?)
🎯 Keep as-is but prep support (What would help you thrive in this schedule?)

What feels most supportive for your beautiful brain?"
