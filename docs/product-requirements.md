## Core Product Vision

BrainSync Pro is an ADHD-friendly AI life orchestration system that **celebrates conscious choice-making** rather than demanding productivity compliance. The system connects scattered apps to provide gentle, understanding guidance via daily emails and real-time text message choice prompts.

### 3. ADHD-Aware Nudging System
- **Initial Prompt**: Gentle text with 3 numbered choices

### Alarmy & Forest Integration Examples

**Sleep-Based Choice Prompts (Alarmy)**:
- Late evening screen time detection: "Your Alarmy shows you wake up better with 7am alarms when you sleep by 11pm. It's 10:30 - wind down now, 15 more minutes, or night owl mode?"
- Morning activation choices: "Alarmy detected you snoozed 3 times. Brain needs gentle activation? Math mission, photo mission, or easy wake-up today?"
- Sleep quality insights: "Your snore analysis shows restless sleep when you have caffeine after 3pm. Coffee decision coming up - what feels right?"

**Focus-Based Choice Prompts (Forest)**:
- Flow state protection: "Forest shows you're 20 minutes into deep focus but there's a meeting request. Keep growing your tree, take a quick break, or end session mindfully?"
- Energy-based session planning: "Your recent Forest data shows 25-minute sessions work better than 45-minute ones on low-energy days. Today's focus block - honor your pattern or try longer?"
- Distraction management: "Forest tree died from phone checking. No judgment! Reset with shorter session, take a real break, or try app-blocking mode?"

**Combined Data Insights**:
- Sleep + Focus correlation: "Alarmy shows great sleep last night, Forest data suggests this is when you do your best 45-minute sessions. Today feels like a deep work day?"
- Energy pattern recognition: "Alarmy sleep quality + Forest session success rates suggest you're a morning person. Reschedule afternoon meeting to honor your peak hours?"

**Emotional Regulation Choice Prompts (Headspace)**:
- Stress detection: "Calendar shows back-to-back meetings and Headspace data suggests you do better with breathing breaks. 3-minute session, walking meditation, or power through?"
- Overwhelm prevention: "Your stress patterns suggest this is a good time for mindfulness. Headspace shows 5-minute anxiety sessions work best for you - try one now?"
- Evening wind-down: "Headspace shows sleep meditations help you transition from work mode. Tonight's choice: 10-minute sleep story, breathing exercise, or skip and doom-scroll?"

**Financial Awareness Choice Prompts (YNAB)**:
- Weekly budget celebration: "YNAB shows you hit your savings goal this week - how do you want to celebrate this win? Treat yourself mindfully, add extra to savings, or just celebrate the awareness?"
- Monthly check-in: "YNAB monthly review time! Your budget categories look balanced - feeling good about your financial awareness journey?"
- Goal progress support: "Your YNAB emergency fund goal is 75% complete - that's amazing progress! Keep the momentum or adjust the timeline?"
