## üöÄ **Development Phases**

### **Phase 1: Text-Based Choice System** ‚ö° *PRIORITY*
**Goal**: Implement realistic text message choice prompts with ADHD-aware nudging

**Features to Build**:
- [ ] **SMS Choice Detection**: Calendar conflict detection with 3-choice text prompts
- [ ] **Number Response Handler**: Process user replies (1, 2, 3) via Twilio webhooks
- [ ] **Gentle Nudging Logic**: 5-minute delay system for non-responders
- [ ] **Smart Assumptions**: Default to choice honoring current state if ignored
- [ ] **Action Execution**: Actually reschedule meetings, send warnings, etc.

**Technical Tasks**:
- [ ] Twilio webhook endpoint for incoming SMS responses
- [ ] Choice prompt generation based on calendar conflicts
- [ ] Google Calendar API rescheduling integration
- [ ] Nudge timing and retry logic
- [ ] Choice response celebration messaging

**ADHD Considerations**:
- Gentle "I don't want to bother you" nudge tone
- Acknowledge procrastination without shame
- Always provide 3 realistic choices
- Celebrate any choice as conscious decision-making

### **Phase 2: Progress Tracking & Visualization** üìä
**Goal**: Add visual progress charts to daily emails showing conscious choice growth

**Features to Build**:
- [ ] **Choice Moment Tracking**: Database schema for choice events
- [ ] **Weekly Progress Charts**: Visual bar charts in email templates
- [ ] **ADHD-Realistic Patterns**: Handle up/down weeks positively
- [ ] **Progress Insights**: AI analysis of choice-making patterns
- [ ] **Email Chart Integration**: Embedded charts in daily guidance emails

**Technical Tasks**:
- [ ] Choice metrics database tables
- [ ] Chart generation for email (SVG or embedded HTML)
- [ ] Weekly aggregation queries
- [ ] Progress insight AI prompts
- [ ] Email template updates with charts

**Success Metrics**:
- Choice awareness growth over time
- User engagement with progress visualizations
- Positive feedback on non-judgmental progress tracking

### **Phase 3: Expanded Data Integration** üîó
**Goal**: Connect comprehensive life data sources for deeper choice insights

**Priority Integrations**:
- [ ] **Sleep Data**: Oura Ring, Apple Health, Samsung Health
- [ ] **Fitness Tracking**: Nike Run Club, Apple Fitness
- [ ] **Digital Wellness**: RescueTime, Screen Time tracking
- [ ] **Productivity Tools**: Todoist, Notion, Slack patterns
- [ ] **Music & Mood**: Spotify listening patterns
- [ ] **Focus Apps**: Focus Bear, Freedom.to integration

**Technical Tasks**:
- [ ] API research and integration for each service
- [ ] Data correlation analysis (sleep vs. choice quality)
- [ ] Privacy-first data collection approach
- [ ] Smart pattern recognition for choice timing

### **Phase 4: Enhanced User Experience** üíô
**Goal**: Refine the gentle guidance system based on user feedback

**Features to Build**:
- [ ] **Voice Response Option**: "Hey Siri, tell BrainSync 2"
- [ ] **Family Integration**: Shared choice awareness for partners
- [ ] **Custom Choice Templates**: User-defined response options
- [ ] **Seasonal Adjustments**: Weather and seasonal mood patterns
- [ ] **Emergency Override**: Immediate response for anxiety/overwhelm

**ADHD Enhancement Focus**:

- Multiple interaction modalities (text, voice, visual)
- Respect for hyperfocus states and energy cycles
- Celebration of neurodivergent thinking patterns

### **Phase 5: Advanced AI & Personalization** üß†
**Goal**: Sophisticated AI that learns individual ADHD patterns

**Features to Build**:
- [ ] **Personal Choice Patterns**: AI learning individual preferences
- [ ] **Predictive Prompting**: Anticipate choice moments before conflicts

## üî¨ **ADHD Research Integration Priorities**

### **High Impact Data Sources**
1. **Sleep Quality** ‚Üí Choice clarity correlation
2. **Weather Patterns** ‚Üí Energy level impacts
3. **Digital Screen Time** ‚Üí Attention residue effects
4. **Exercise Timing** ‚Üí Flow state optimization
5. **Social Calendar Density** ‚Üí Overwhelm prediction

### **Research Questions to Answer**
- How does sleep quality affect choice response time?
- What weather patterns correlate with "flow state" choices?
- Can we predict overwhelm before it happens?
- How do exercise patterns influence choice clarity?
- What music/environment combinations support best choices?

## üéØ **Success Metrics by Phase**

### **Phase 1 Metrics**
- 70%+ choice prompt response rate
- <2% users finding nudges annoying
- 90% user satisfaction with gentle tone

### **Phase 2 Metrics**
- Increased choice awareness (measurable growth week-over-week)
- High engagement with progress visualizations
- Positive sentiment around "ups and downs are normal"

### **Phase 3 Metrics**
- Improved choice timing accuracy
- Higher quality AI insights from integrated data
- User retention improvement from comprehensive understanding

## üìù **Notes for Daniel**

### **ADHD-Friendly Development Approach**
- ‚úÖ Build in small, complete chunks
- ‚úÖ Test with real ADHD users frequently  
- ‚úÖ Prioritize working features over perfect features
- ‚úÖ Document everything (for when we forget context)
- ‚úÖ Celebrate progress, even small wins

### **Technical Debt to Manage**
- Keep text message system simple and reliable
- Avoid feature creep in choice prompts
- Maintain gentle tone consistency across all interactions
- Regular user feedback integration cycles
