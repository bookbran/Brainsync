### 🔄 Current Phase: N8N Workflow Deployment
**Owner:** Daniel (Project Manager)  
**Timeline:** 45-60 minutes  
**Critical Path:** Credentials → Import → Test → Activate

#### Required Steps (In Order):
1. **Set up N8N credentials** (Supabase, Google, Weather, Claude, SendGrid)
2. **Import both workflows** (Data Collection + AI Analysis)
3. **Create test user in database** (daniel@brainsyncpro.com)
4. **Test workflow execution** (Data collection → AI analysis → Email)
5. **Activate production schedules** (Every 30min + Daily 6AM)

### 🎯 Next Phase: Landing Page Creation
**Owner:** Claude (Technical Lead)  
**Dependencies:** Working workflows deployed and tested
**Deliverables:**
- MVP landing page with ADHD-optimized copy
- User onboarding flow  
- Payment integration (Stripe)
- A/B testing implementation

## 💰 Cost Structure (Validated)

### Monthly Operating Costs
- N8N Cloud: $20/month (Starter plan) ✅
- Supabase: $0-25/month (Pro plan when needed) ✅
- SendGrid: $0-20/month (starts free) ✅
- Claude API: ~$10-50/month (usage-based) ✅
- Google APIs: Free tier sufficient for MVP ✅
- OpenWeatherMap: Free tier sufficient ✅

**Total MVP Cost:** ~$50-115/month ✅

### Revenue Model (Ready)
- Free: 3 integrations, daily email
- Pro ($24/month): Unlimited integrations, SMS, advanced AI
- Team ($49/month): Family accounts
- Enterprise ($99/month): White-glove setup

## 🚨 Current Blockers & Risks

### Immediate Blockers
1. **N8N credentials setup** - Daniel needs to configure 5 credential types
2. **Workflow import** - Copy/paste JSON workflow definitions  
3. **Test execution** - Verify end-to-end data flow works

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk:** Database schema (already deployed), API keys (collected)
- **Medium Risk:** N8N workflow complexity, OAuth configuration
- **High Risk:** Claude API costs (need usage monitoring)

---

## 📞 Communication Protocol

### Status Updates
**Daniel Reports:** N8N deployment progress, test results, any errors
**Claude Responds:** Technical troubleshooting, optimization guidance

### Current Escalation
**Expected Message:** "N8N workflows deployed, credentials configured, test user created. Data collection and AI analysis working. Ready for production."

**Potential Issues:**
- Workflow import errors → Claude provides troubleshooting
- Credential configuration problems → Claude guides setup
- Test execution failures → Claude debugs workflow logic

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria - Current Phase

### N8N Deployment Requirements
- [ ] All 5 credentials configured in N8N (Supabase, Google, Weather, Claude, SendGrid)
- [ ] Both workflows imported successfully
- [ ] Test user created in database with integrations
- [ ] Data collection workflow executes without errors
- [ ] AI analysis workflow generates email and stores report
- [ ] Both workflows activated on production schedule

### Quality Gates
- Data appears in `data_points` table after collection
- Email received with personalized ADHD recommendations
- Report logged in `reports` table with AI analysis
- No authentication errors in workflow execution
- End-to-end flow completes in under 5 minutes

---

## 📋 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**Daniel's Current Task:**
1. Follow `/docs/n8n-deployment-guide.md` step by step
2. Start with credentials setup (Phase 1)
3. Import workflows (Phase 2)  
4. Create test user (Phase 3)
5. Test both workflows (Phase 4)
6. Activate schedules (Phase 5)
7. Report completion with screenshots

**Claude's Next Phase:**
Once N8N is deployed and working:
1. Create MVP landing page using ADHD strategy
2. Build user onboarding flow
3. Implement payment processing (Stripe)
4. Set up A/B testing framework
5. Launch beta with first 50 ADHD users
