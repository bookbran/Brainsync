-- üöÄ 7. QUICK TEST USER LOOKUP
-- ===========================================

-- Find your test user (replace phone number with one from your test)
SELECT 
    u.*,
    c.id as conversation_id,
    c.current_phase,
    c.phase_completion_status
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN conversations c ON u.active_conversation_id = c.id
WHERE u.phone LIKE '+1555%'  -- Adjust based on your test phone numbers
ORDER BY u.created_at DESC;

-- ===========================================
-- üí° USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
-- ===========================================
/*
1. Run the test script: .\manual-test.ps1
2. Note the phone number it generates
3. Use "Query 7" to find your test user
4. Use "Query 1" to see conversation progress  
5. Use "Query 2" to see message flow
6. Use "Query 3" to see captured insights
7. Use "Query 5" to track phase completion

Key things to watch for:
- current_phase should advance (1‚Üí2‚Üí3...)
- phase_completion_status should update
- conversation_extracts should capture insights
- message_order should increment properly
