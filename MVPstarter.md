## üìö Documentation Reference Prompt

When starting a new development step, use this prompt template to ensure comprehensive understanding and proper implementation:

```
I'm working on implementing [STEP_NAME] from the BrainSync MVP development roadmap. As the technical lead, please take charge of this implementation by:

1. First, reviewing these key documents:
   - `gogetit.md` - For the overall development roadmap and step details
   - `docs/enhanced-onboarding-flow.md` - For conversation framework and user interaction patterns
   - `docs/product-requirements.md` - For detailed feature specifications
   - `docs/database-schema.md` - For data structure and relationships
   - `docs/adhd-landing-page-strategy.md` - For UI/UX context and positioning

2. Then, provide a clear directive plan:
   - Tell me exactly what we're building in this step
   - Specify the ADHD-friendly considerations we must implement
   - List all dependencies we need to set up
   - Give me a step-by-step implementation plan
   - Define the success criteria we must meet

3. Finally, lead the implementation:
   - Tell me exactly what to do first
   - Guide me through testing each component
   - Ensure we're following the ADHD-friendly development principles
   - Document our decisions and progress

As the technical lead, please be directive and confident in your approach. I trust your expertise in building this system for the ADHD community. Begin by reviewing the documentation and providing your technical analysis and implementation plan.
