# Streamlined ADHD Landing Page - Implementation Specification

## 🤖 PROMPT FOR CLAUDE 4 SONNET IN CURSOR

You are tasked with creating a new streamlined landing page component for goodberry that focuses specifically on ADHD users who need quick, digestible information to make a waitlist signup decision. This is NOT replacing the existing landing page - instead, you'll create a toggle system where users can switch between "Detailed View" (current page) and "Quick View" (new streamlined page).

**Key Requirements:**
1. Create a new component called `StreamlinedApp.tsx` that mirrors the structure of `CalendarApp.tsx`
2. Add a toggle switch to the main App.tsx that lets users switch between "Detailed View" and "Quick View"
3. Use the existing design system, colors, fonts, and component patterns from the current landing page
4. Focus on visual hierarchy, minimal text, and immediate value clarity for ADHD brains
5. Keep all interactive elements and phone demos but make them more prominent and auto-engaging
6. Maintain the same waitlist signup functionality
