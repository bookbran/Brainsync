## üé≠ BRAND TONE & MESSAGING STRATEGY

**Target Audience Psychographics:**
- People with ADHD who are tired of dropping balls
- Self-aware about their productivity struggles
- Appreciate humor about their quirks and challenges
- Want solutions that "get it" rather than generic productivity advice
- Often overthink simple tasks but miss obvious things
- Crave systems that work WITH their brain, not against it
- Feel guilty about "unproductive" time and need permission to be human

- **Conversational & Understanding** - Like talking to a friend who also has ADHD
- **Self-Deprecating Humor** - Acknowledge the absurdity of ADHD life
- **Empowering but Realistic** - Hope without toxic positivity
- **Choice-Celebrating** - Honor all decisions, even "unproductive" ones

- "For people who set 12 alarms and still oversleep"
- "It's okay to choose Netflix over your to-do list - we just want you to choose it consciously"
- "Celebrating your active choices, even the 'bad' ones"

**Landing Page Research Focus Areas:**

## üåà ADHD-FRIENDLY CHOICE EMPOWERMENT PHILOSOPHY

### üé™ Core Empowerment Principles

**1. Choice Over Compliance**
- Focus on **active decision-making** rather than forced productivity
- Celebrate when users consciously choose "unproductive" activities
- Track and reward self-awareness, not just task completion

**2. Gentle Guidance Over Guilt**
- Text prompts that are funny, understanding, and non-judgmental
- Questions that invite reflection without pressure
- Acknowledgment that some days are harder than others

**3. Progress Through Awareness**
- Measure improvement in conscious choice-making over time
- Report on patterns without shame or pressure
- Celebrate small wins and self-compassion

**4. Permission to Be Human**
- Normalize ADHD struggles and "unproductive" choices
- Provide data that shows balance and growth over time
- Remove toxic productivity pressure

### üéà Implementation Strategy

**Daily Gentle Prompts:**
Instead of: "You have 3 tasks due today"
We say: "Hey there! üëã Your brain planned some stuff for today. Ready to tackle your schedule, or are you deep in something else that's calling to you? Both are totally valid choices!"

**Choice-Point Check-ins:**
- "Looks like you're supposed to be in a meeting in 20 minutes, but I see you haven't moved from your current task. Want to switch gears, or shall we let them know you're in a productive flow? üåä"
- "Your habit tracker suggests this is writing time, but I get it if you're feeling more of a 'reorganize your entire music library' vibe today. What's your brain wanting to do?"

**Weekly Celebration Reports:**
- "This week you made 23 conscious choices about your time - that's incredible self-awareness! üéâ"
- "You chose to follow your planned schedule 67% of the time and chose to do something else 33% of the time. Both show you're actively engaged with your life!"
- "Your 'productive procrastination' sessions this week included organizing, researching, and learning - your brain was still working, just differently!"
