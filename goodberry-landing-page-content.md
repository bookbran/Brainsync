#### Why the name "goodberry"?
"In Dungeons & Dragons, there's this magical spell called **goodberry**. Here's the thing about it: when your character is completely dead‚Äîlike, actually dead, not just knocked out‚Äîa single goodberry can bring you back to life with exactly +1 hit point (HP).

Just +1 HP. That's it. Barely alive. But here's what's magical about it...

**You're not dead anymore.** You can cast spells again. You can help your party. You can think clearly. You can make choices. You can participate in your own adventure again.

That's exactly what we're building for ADHD brains struggling with calendar overwhelm. Maybe you're in "dead party member" mode right now‚Äîfeeling overwhelmed, paralyzed by choices, unable to trust your own scheduling decisions.

**goodberry isn't trying to make you a productivity superhero overnight.** We're just trying to get you to +1 HP. To help you feel alive in your calendar again. To celebrate that you made any choice at all, rather than staying frozen.

Because once you're at +1 HP and feeling good about your choices? That's when the real magic happens. That's when you start thriving again."
